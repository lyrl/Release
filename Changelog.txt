1.9.2017-01
GENERAL
- CORE UPDATE: Action Slot 25 will no more be used to hold every abilities. Abilities will now be scanned and the positions they are in your bars will be stored. If you have learned abilities and those are not in your bars, the core will add these to your right action bars, slots 25+. You can then take these abilities and move these around as you like but they need to be somewhere.
-- As a result of this change, changing abilities from bars to bars while to rotations are running should not be an issue anymore. If you select an item, the manager gives you up to 5 seconds to place it to it's new localtion, after this delay, it will clear the cursor and place it back to 25+ slots.
--- This will fix the problem where we were hearing action bar items changed during fight as well as keeping the improved functionality from using Action Slots.
